# Marcel Dias

I've been working as a software developer since 2005. As a software developer I've worked for companies in these industries segments: software, financial, health and news. I'm always looking for tools and process improvements to find the best way to delivery quality software. I also try to help teams to create and keep the best environment to develop software.

Acting as a software developer I do my best to deliver effective and efficient software solutions. Use technology to solve business problems. I like to automate tasks to boost productivity and be able keep focus on coding. Writing automated tests is the best way I've found to deliver readable and maintainable code.

I'm really interested in use technological solutions to improve people life and how they do business.
