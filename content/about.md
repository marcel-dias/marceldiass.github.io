# Marcel Dias

I've been working as a software developer since 2005. Worked in financial, health, news and software business segments. I'm always looking for tools and process improvements to find the best way to delivery quality software. I also try to help teams to create and keep the best climate to develop software.

Acting as a software developer I always try to do my best to deliver effective and efficient software solutions. I like to automate tasks to get a best productivity and keep doing code. I've learned to write unit test to always deliver maintainable code.

I have interest in agile methods, software design, software architecture, user experience, entrepreneurship, web technologies and value delivery.
